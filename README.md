# Hotel Booking Cancellations Analysis

## Problem Statement
City and Resort Hotels face high booking cancellation rates, which lead to reduced revenue and inefficient room occupancy. This project aims to analyze the factors contributing to booking cancellations and provide insights to improve hotel performance.


## Hypotheses
- Higher prices lead to more cancellations.
- Longer waiting lists for room allotment result in more frequent cancellations.
- The majority of reservations come from offline travel agents.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language for data analysis.
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: Data visualization library for statistical graphics.
- Matplotlib: Plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running Python code and visualizing data.
